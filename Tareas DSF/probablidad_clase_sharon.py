#**Probability**

*Chance of an event occurring.*

Probability shows how possible it is that an event occurs.
It is a measure of the frequency of an event, that is, how much happens the event that satisfies a condition.

*Number of ways of achieving a condition / the total number of possible outcomes*

###** **Permutations & Combinations**

There are two ways to sort or combine results of dependent events. 

- **Permutations** are groupings in which the order of objects matters. 
- **Combinations** are groupings in which the content matters but the order does not.


*It helps a lot to use trees*
